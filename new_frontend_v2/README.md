## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Setup**
```bash
# Clone or copy the new_frontend_v2 directory
# Serve the files using any web server

# Using Python (if available)
cd new_frontend_v2
python -m http.server 8080

# Using Node.js (if available)
npx serve .

# Or use any other web server
```

### 2. **Access the Application**
Open your browser and navigate to:
- `http://localhost:8080` (if using Python server)
- Or wherever you're serving the files

### 3. **Login**
The application will show a login screen where you can:
- **Connect to real Odoo**: Enter your Odoo server details

## 🔧 Configuration

### **API Configuration**
The frontend automatically detects and connects to the Extended Attendance backend. If the backend is not available, it falls back to mock data for development.

### **Theme Customization**
Themes can be customized by modifying CSS variables in `css/main.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #3498db;
    --success-color: #2ecc71;
    --warning-color: #f39c12;
    --danger-color: #e74c3c;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### **Mock Data**
For development without a backend, the system includes realistic mock data:
- Sample person types (Admin, Employee, Student, Guest)
- Multiple locations with occupancy data
- Current attendance records
- Realistic statistics

## 📱 Mobile Support

The frontend is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices:
- **Touch-friendly**: Large buttons and touch targets
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Mobile Navigation**: Collapsible sidebar for mobile
- **Optimized Forms**: Mobile-friendly form inputs

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation with server-side verification
- **Secure API Calls**: Proper authentication and error handling
- **Data Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized before display

## 🚀 Performance

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Efficient Updates**: Only re-render changed data
- **Caching**: Smart caching of API responses
- **Optimized Assets**: Minimal CSS and JavaScript footprint

## 🔧 Development

### **Adding New Features**
1. Create component in `js/components/`
2. Add to navigation in `index.html`
3. Register in `app.js`
4. Add styles in `css/components.css`

### **API Integration**
All API calls go through the `ExtendedOdooAPI` class in `js/core/extended-odoo-api.js`. Add new endpoints there.

### **State Management**
Use the global `appState` object for managing application state. Subscribe to changes for reactive updates.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**
- Check if the Odoo server is running
- Verify the URL and credentials
- Check browser console for errors
- Try using mock data mode for development

### **Performance Issues**
- Clear browser cache
- Check network connectivity
- Reduce auto-refresh interval in settings

### **Display Issues**
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear application cache in settings
- Check browser compatibility (modern browsers required)
